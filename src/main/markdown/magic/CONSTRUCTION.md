##### Sample Spells

**Elemental Fire Strike**

> Elemental Bolt, Lesser, Fire

Damage(1), Fire(2) = 3 * Lesser Elemental(3) = 9
Line of Sight(5), 1 target(1), Instant(1 Attack x 2) = 8
= 17 / 5 = 3.4 = 4 MP

**Heal Self**

> Heal 100% Hits or +20/r Bleed or E Crit 

Heal(1), Body(3) = 4 * 20 = 80
Self(1), Self(0), Instant(1) = 2
= 82 / 5 =  16.4 = 17 MP

**Cure Light Wounds**

> Heal 10% Hits or +2/r Bleed

Heal(1), Body(3) = 4 * 2 = 8
Touch(2), 1 Target(1), Instant(1) = 4
= 12 / 5 =  2.4 = 3 MP

**Shield of Shadow**

> Protection +25DB

Protect(2), Physical(2) = 4 * 5 = 20
Self(1), Self(0), 5 rounds(3) = 4
= 24 / 5 = 4.8 = 5MP


##### Mechanics

* simple : standard open-ended roll with either skill or stat-only bonus ... 100+ means success
* contest : standard open-ended roll with either skill or stat-only bonus ... contestant needs to roll against this ... also used in RR
* attack :  standard open-ended roll with either skill or stat-only bonus minus DB ... result is looked up in attack table with applicable armor
* movement :  standard open-ended roll with either skill or stat-only bonus minus MM penalties ...  result is looked up in maneuver table
* resistance roll : as in contest above ... a failed RR establishes a level of failure = (the difference divided by 10 rounded down)
* critical : if any of the above methods establish a critical result (A..E) d100 is rolled with possible modifiers and looked up on the appropriate table
* effect roll : a special case of the RR, where the contestant does not choose to resist .. the effect level becomes the "tens" of the result
