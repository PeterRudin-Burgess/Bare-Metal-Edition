### Spell Builder

for cost tables see the adjunct tables.

#### Magic Magnitude

For each spell a magnitude (power level) must be established.
This will than be used to calculate or approximate the mechanical effect.

The following basic rules apply:

* for attack spells, the magnitude is usually equal to the OB.
* for defensive combat spells, the magnitude is usually equal to the DB.
* for protective spells, the magnitude is usually equal to the RR bonus.
* for spells which can be resisted, the magnitude is usually equal to the RR penalty.
* for spells which can be resisted, the RRs failure level is usually used for the magnitude of the effect.

For actual building costs the magnitude is multiplied by the sum of actions and objectives
and divided by 5 and rounded up.

#### Cantrips

Cantrips have the following limitations:

* the final cost before adjustment for cantrip bonus cannot be more than 100.
* duration cannot be more than 1 minute or 1 round/Rank.
* range cannot be mor than 50ft.
* area/targets cannot be more than 1 target or a 30ft Radius.
* the magic has no scaling options

if a spell falls within this constraints, it is considered a cantrip and
the spell build cost is adjusted by -45. 

#### Sample Spells

##### Basic Attack Spells

**Magic Missile (Cantrip)**

> Bolt, Arrow (+20OB)

```
Damage(M x 3), Physical(M x 8) = (3+8) * (20/5) = 44
Line of Sight(25), 1 target(5), Instant(3) = 33
Cantrip(-45)
= (77 - 45) / 25 = 32 / 25 = 1.28 = 2 MP
```

If the spell-casting roll is a success, 
the roll plus the +20OB is used with 
the Arrow/Bolt/Missle Attack Table.

**Magic Missile (Spell)**

> Bolt, Arrow (+50OB)

```
Damage(M x 3), Physical(M x 8) = (3+8) * (50/5) = 110
Line of Sight(25), 1 target(5), Instant(3) = 33
= 143 / 25 = 5.72 = 6 MP
```

If the spell-casting roll is a success, 
the roll plus the +50OB is used with 
the Arrow/Bolt/Missle Attack Table.

> Alternative Attack Table Magic Missile with Puncture Criticals.

*Scaling Options:*

* +1MP per +5OB

##### Alternative Attack Spells

**Elemental Earth Strike**

> Elemental Bolt, Earth (+25OB)

```
Damage(M x 3), Elemental Earth(M x 8) = (3+8) * (25/5) = 55
Line of Sight(25), 1 target(5), Instant(3) = 33
= 88 / 25 = 3.52 = 4 MP
```

If the spell-casting roll is a success, 
the roll plus the +25OB is used with 
the Magic Missile Attack Table 
and Krush Criticals.

* +1MP per +5OB
 
**Elemental Fire Ball**

> Elemental Ball, Fire (+25OB)

```
Damage(M x 3), Elemental Fire(M x 8) = (3+8) * (25/5) = 55
Line of Sight(25), 10ft Radius(30), Instant(3) = 58
= 113 / 25 = 4.xy = 5 MP
```

If the spell-casting roll is a success, 
the roll plus the +25OB is used with 
the Magic Ball Attack Table 
and Fire Criticals.

*Scaling Options:*

* +1MP per +5OB

##### Basic Augment Spells

##### Alternative Augment Spells

##### Basic Barrier/Protection Spells

Protect(6), Physical(8) = (6+8) * (25/5) = 70
Self(5), Self(0), 1 rounds/Rank (20) = 25
= 99 / 25 = 3.xy = 4MP
```

*Scaling Options:*

* +1MP per +5DB

#### Mechanics

* simple : standard open-ended roll with either skill or stat-only bonus ... 100+ means success
* contest : standard open-ended roll with either skill or stat-only bonus ... contestant needs to roll against this ... also used in RR
* attack :  standard open-ended roll with either skill or stat-only bonus minus DB ... result is looked up in attack table with applicable armor
* movement :  standard open-ended roll with either skill or stat-only bonus minus MM penalties ...  result is looked up in maneuver table
* resistance roll : as in contest above ... a failed RR establishes a level of failure = (the difference divided by 10 rounded down)
* critical : if any of the above methods establish a critical result (A..E) d100 is rolled with possible modifiers and looked up on the appropriate table
* effect roll : a special case of the RR, where the contestant does not choose to resist .. the effect level becomes the "tens" of the result
