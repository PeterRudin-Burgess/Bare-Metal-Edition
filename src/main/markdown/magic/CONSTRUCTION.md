###### Cantrips

Cantrips are limited by the build cost of not more than 20.
if a spell falls within this constraint, the build cost is adjusted by -10. 

##### Sample Spells

**Magic Missile (Cantrip)**

> Bolt, Arrow (+20OB)

Damage(1), Physical(2) = 3 * (20/5) = 12
Line of Sight(5), 1 target(1), Instant(1) = 7
Cantrip(-10)
= 9 / 5 = 1.8 = 2 MP

*Scaling Options:*

* +1MP per +5OB
 
**Elemental Fire Strike**

> Elemental Bolt, Fire (+25OB)

Damage(1), Fire(2), Elemental(2) = 5 * (25/5) = 25
Line of Sight(5), 1 target(1), Instant(1 Attack x 2) = 8
= 33 / 5 = 6.6 = 7 MP

*Scaling Options:*

* +1MP per +5OB
 
**Heal Self**

> Heal 100% Hits or +20/r Bleed or E Crit 

Heal(1), Body(3) = 4 * (100/5) = 80
Self(1), Self(0), Instant(1) = 2
= 82 / 5 =  16.4 = 17 MP

**Cure Light Wounds**

> Heal 10% Hits or +2/r Bleed

Heal(1), Body(3) = 4 * (10/5) = 8
Touch(2), 1 Target(1), Instant(1) = 4
= 12 / 5 =  2.4 = 3 MP

**Shield of Shadow**

> Protection +25DB

Protect(2), Physical(2) = 4 * 5 = 20
Self(1), Self(0), 2 rounds/Rank (4) = 5
= 25 / 5 = 5MP


##### Mechanics

* simple : standard open-ended roll with either skill or stat-only bonus ... 100+ means success
* contest : standard open-ended roll with either skill or stat-only bonus ... contestant needs to roll against this ... also used in RR
* attack :  standard open-ended roll with either skill or stat-only bonus minus DB ... result is looked up in attack table with applicable armor
* movement :  standard open-ended roll with either skill or stat-only bonus minus MM penalties ...  result is looked up in maneuver table
* resistance roll : as in contest above ... a failed RR establishes a level of failure = (the difference divided by 10 rounded down)
* critical : if any of the above methods establish a critical result (A..E) d100 is rolled with possible modifiers and looked up on the appropriate table
* effect roll : a special case of the RR, where the contestant does not choose to resist .. the effect level becomes the "tens" of the result
