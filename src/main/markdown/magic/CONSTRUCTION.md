### Spell Builder

for cost tables see the adjunct tables.

#### Magic Magnitude

For each spell a magnitude (power level) must be established.
This will than be used to calculate or approximate the mechanical effect.

The following basic rules apply:

* for attack spells, the magnitude is usually equal to the OB.
* for defensive combat spells, the magnitude is usually equal to the DB.
* for protective spells, the magnitude is usually equal to the RR bonus.
* for spells which can be resisted, the magnitude is usually equal to the RR penalty.
* for spells which can be resisted, the RRs failure level is usually used for the magnitude of the effect.

For actual building costs the magnitude is multiplied by the sum of actions and objectives
and divided by 5 and rounded up.

#### Cantrips

Cantrips have the following limitations:

* the final cost before adjustment for cantrip bonus cannot be more than 100.
* duration cannot be more than 1 minute or 1 round/Rank.
* range cannot be mor than 50ft.
* area/targets cannot be more than 1 target or a 30ft Radius.
* the magic has no scaling options

if a spell falls within this constraints, it is considered a cantrip and
the spell build cost is adjusted by -45. 

#### Sample Spells

##### Basic Attack Spells

**Magic Missile (Cantrip)**

> Bolt, Arrow (+20OB)

```
Damage(M x 3), Physical(M x 8) = (3+8) * (20/5) = 44
Line of Sight(25), 1 target(5), Instant(3) = 33
Cantrip(-45)
= (77 - 45) / 25 = 32 / 25 = 1.28 = 2 MP
```

If the spell-casting roll is a success, 
the roll plus the +20OB is used with 
the Arrow/Bolt/Missle Attack Table.

**Magic Missile (Spell)**

> Bolt, Arrow (+50OB)

```
Damage(M x 3), Physical(M x 8) = (3+8) * (50/5) = 110
Line of Sight(25), 1 target(5), Instant(3) = 33
= 143 / 25 = 5.72 = 6 MP
```

If the spell-casting roll is a success, 
the roll plus the +50OB is used with 
the Arrow/Bolt/Missle Attack Table.

> Alternative Attack Table Magic Missile with Puncture Criticals.

*Scaling Options:*

* +1MP per +5OB

##### Alternative Attack Spells

**Elemental Earth Strike**

> Elemental Bolt, Earth (+25OB)

```
Damage(M x 3), Elemental Earth(M x 8) = (3+8) * (25/5) = 55
Line of Sight(25), 1 target(5), Instant(3) = 33
= 88 / 25 = 3.52 = 4 MP
```

If the spell-casting roll is a success, 
the roll plus the +25OB is used with 
the Magic Missile Attack Table 
and Krush Criticals.

*Scaling Options:*

* +1MP per +5OB
 
**Elemental Fire Ball**

> Elemental Ball, Fire (+25OB)

```
Damage(M x 3), Elemental Fire(M x 8) = (3+8) * (25/5) = 55
Line of Sight(25), 10ft Radius(30), Instant(3) = 58
= 113 / 25 = 4.xy = 5 MP
```

If the spell-casting roll is a success, 
the roll plus the +25OB is used with 
the Magic Ball Attack Table 
and Fire Criticals.

*Scaling Options:*

* +1MP per +5OB

##### Basic Augment Spells

##### Alternative Augment Spells

##### Basic Barrier/Protection Spells

**Shield of Protection**

> Protection +25DB

```
Protect(6), Physical(8) = (6+8) * (25/5) = 70
Self(5), Self(0), 1 rounds/Rank (20) = 25
= 99 / 25 = 3.xy = 4MP
```

*Scaling Options:*

* +1MP per +5DB

##### Alternative Barrier/Protection Spells

**Protection from Undead**

> Barrier -25RR

```
Protect(6), Spiritual(12) = (6+12) * (25/5) = 90 
Touch(10), 30ft radius(45), 1 rounds/Rank (20) = 75
= 165 / 25 = 6.xy = 7MP
```

Undead (both physical and incorporal) cannot enter the area protected by the spell if failing the RR.

Undead inside the area during spellcasting receive appropriate critical effects based on the level of failure and are forcefully moved out.

##### Basic Heal Spells

**Cure Light Wounds**

> Heal 10 Hits or 2/round Bleed or 1 round of stun

```
Heal(M x 3), Body(M x 12) = (3+12) * (10/5) = 30
Touch(10), 1 Target(5), Instant(3) = 18
= 48 / 25 =  1.xy = 2 MP
```

**Heal Self**

> Heal 100 Hits or 20/round Bleed or 10 rounds of stun or stops auxilary critcal damage table results up to 100,
> but does attach but not regrow severed limbs. Cannot heal a pile of dust. 

```
Heal(M x 3), Body(M x 12) = (3+12) * (100/5) = 300
Self(5), Self(0), Instant(3) = 8
= 308 / 25 =  12.xy = 13 MP
```

##### Alternative Heal Spells

**Regenerate Body**

> Regenerate a body if at least 50% is still available living or dead or severed.
> Does not heal hits or stun nor prevent death or give life to a dead body.

```
Create(M x 12), Body(M x 12) = (12+12) * (100/5) = 480
Touch(10), 1 Target(5), Instant(3) = 18
= 498 / 25 = 19.xy = 20 MP

#### Mechanics

* simple : standard open-ended roll with either skill or stat-only bonus ... 100+ means success
* contest : standard open-ended roll with either skill or stat-only bonus ... contestant needs to roll against this ... also used in RR
* attack :  standard open-ended roll with either skill or stat-only bonus minus DB ... result is looked up in attack table with applicable armor
* movement :  standard open-ended roll with either skill or stat-only bonus minus MM penalties ...  result is looked up in maneuver table
* resistance roll : as in contest above ... a failed RR establishes a level of failure = (the difference divided by 10 rounded down)
* critical : if any of the above methods establish a critical result (A..E) d100 is rolled with possible modifiers and looked up on the appropriate table
* effect roll : a special case of the RR, where the contestant does not choose to resist .. the effect level becomes the "tens" of the result


## TODO

[2:23 PM] Terefang: hmm ....
[2:25 PM] Terefang: i am a little divided between a fear mechanic and something else ... because the reasoning falls apart for mindless undead
[2:29 PM] Terefang: maybe i should recount of what i have come up so far ...
[2:30 PM] Peter R: I didn't mean that the turning undead would have them suffering a fear attack
[2:30 PM] Peter R: I meant that we could try and treat everything as a resistance roll.
[2:31 PM] Peter R: So turning undead would be vs a resistance roll, but demons/dragons or whatever that have a fear power could be resisted using an RR
[2:31 PM] Peter R: one of the 5 pairs you created earlier
[2:31 PM] Terefang: yes the resistance roll is what i have in mind but the actual effect is debateable
[2:31 PM] Peter R: Willpower/determination to resist fear?
[2:32 PM] Terefang: yes
[2:32 PM] Terefang: the mechanic would be the RR
[2:32 PM] Terefang: let me list the effects
[2:34 PM] Terefang: * turn/repel ... the undead are driven away from the caster as if subject to a fear spell for RR failed magnitude in rounds or minutes -- ie must use their max movement rate to get away from the caster
[2:35 PM] Terefang: (1 round or minute per 10 failed RR)
[2:38 PM] Terefang: * slow ... the undead are stunned (as per standard combat chapter) for RR failed magnitude in rounds or minutes
[2:41 PM] Terefang: * protection circle/field ... the undead receive a flat action penalty (baked into the spell) for the spell duration (no RR) as long as they are within the field
[2:45 PM] Terefang: * destroy ... undead receive damage a number of hits per RR failed ... physical undead are destroyed on 50+ ... incorporeal undead are destroyed on 100+ (RR failed)
[2:55 PM] Terefang: * divine/holy channel or field -- the channel would be a one-time attack (bolt or ball) resolved on an attack table
... the continuous field would be an once per round attack resolved on an attack table
... or if sufficient magnitude is baked into the spell could be a critical (roll) once per round (magnitude levels for A-E need to be established)
[2:55 PM] Terefang: so
[2:55 PM] Terefang: thats it so far
[2:59 PM] Terefang: turn/repel ... would use willpower/detemination to resist
[2:59 PM] Terefang: slow and destroy ... would use resilience/toughness to resist
[3:00 PM] Terefang: protect ... cannot be resisted
[3:02 PM] Terefang: channel ... is an attack and uses DB of the target.
[3:13 PM] Terefang: what i am uncertain about is the field 
... yes it is basically an attack and should be resolved as such but only on the first round
... on the second round the undead effected are engulfed in the field and the DB mechanic does not apply 
... but rather a RR based on resilience/toughness.
[3:15 PM] Terefang: maybe it is better to drop the field concept for an area-based destroy
[3:18 PM] Terefang: then again a "critical roll per round" effect would be cool ... could be an alternative for destroy ... let me text this:
[3:20 PM] Terefang: * destroy ... undead receive a A/B/C/D/E critical per round for a number of rounds per RR magnitude failed
[3:25 PM] Terefang: this could be visualized by seeing the undead be torn apart by several fires (critcals) over a number of rounds :wink:
[3:27 PM] Terefang: and it is unlikely that you dont kill with 10 critical rolls ... which would make it equivalent to the destruct on 100+ RR failed.
[3:27 PM] Terefang: @Peter R what do you think ?
