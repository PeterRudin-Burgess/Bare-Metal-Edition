## The Magic System

The basic magic system of BME is based on the following principles:

* any would-be magic-user has to have at least one tier in the Magic Gift Talent
* has developed (or defaults) the Mana Point Development Skill.
* has developed at least the minimum skill-ranks in the spell intended to cast.

### The Magic Gift Talent

The magic gift talent costs 5DP per tier and can only be bought at character creation.
Please note some Ancestries, Cultures and/or Archetypes may provide bonus tiers to the talent.

| Magic Gift Tier       | MP Dev | Spells |
|:---------------------|:------:|:------:|
| Tier #0 - None        |   -   |   -   |
| Tier #1 - Initiate    |  8/8  | 7/10  |
| Tier #2 - Student     |  6/6  | 5/7   |
| Tier #3 - Scholar     |  4/4  | 3/5   |
| Tier #4 - Master      |  3/3  | 2/4   |
| Tier #5 - Savant      |  2/2  | 1/3   |
| Tier #6 - Oracle*     |  1/1  | 1/1   |

### Aspects

There are two aspects to magic. The first is mana points. 
These are bought as a skill. A character with 5 ranks in Magic Power and 
a +10 stat bonus would have a total of 35 Mana Points [MP]. 
You may not develop the Magic Power skill unless you have at least one tier 
in the Magic Gift talent.

The second element is the actual spells and rituals known and have a base cost in MP and 
additional options that can scale the effects in different ways. 
You may not use a spell until you have sufficient ranks in that spell to meet the base 
cost and you may not put more MP into a spell than you have ranks in that spell.

*Every spell and ritual is usually developed individually!*

> NOTE: A GM may allow multiple spells to be developed at the same time.

Many effects are dependent on the number of ranks known in the spell or ritual.

Durations listed as rounds/rank will last for that many rounds for a single expenditure of MP.

If the duration has a number of rounds and a (C), the duration is the number of rounds or 
until concentration is broken/stopped.

Some spells and rituals can be reversed to produce an opposite effect. If this is possible 
it is listed in the description. The reversed version must be learned independently of the 
original. You cannot just decide in the moment which version you want.

### Using Spells and Rituals

Using magic is called Casting. To cast a spell or a ritual the caster makes 
a d100 roll only adding their Stat Bonuses to the Casting Roll (CR). 

A caster declares the spell to be cast and the action takes 
up to 3AP. At the end of the action the CR is made. 

> Note: The roll is open ended both up and down.

If the final result is greater than zero the effect is successfully cast and takes effect.

If the spell can be resisted and the target is unwilling they may resist. 
To resist they make a Resistance Test rolled d100 and adding the sum of 
two of their stats based on the nature of the Resistance.
If their Resistance Test result if greater than the casting roll then they 
have resisted the effect. 
If a magic has been resisted it has no effect. Resistance Tests are not compulsory. 
You do not need to resist a magic that you consent to. 
If you withdraw consent at any time before the magic is complete a resistance test is allowed.

This rule exists explicitly to prevent someone being told that the magic is healing 
when in reality it is an attempt to control or harm. 

### Rituals vs Spells

Rituals differ from Spells in a few points.

* have a fixed MP cost
* have a casting time of two minutes per MP expended
* the minimal number of ranks needed to cast a ritual is half the MP cost (rounded up).

> A ritual with a cost of 17MP can be cast by having 9 ranks in the skill 
> and would require 34 minutes to cast.

### Resolving Magic Effects

Attacks are resolved by summing: the result of the casting roll, the spells bonus,
minus the defensive bonus of the target and determining the result on the appropriate 
attack table.

Most other spells are subject to resistance rolls. 
The failure level is either used as a modifier for rolls 
or to establish the magnitude of the effect.

Spells that emulate the usage of skills are resolved exactly in the same way.

### Mana Point Recovery

A full complement of Mana Points [MP] is recovered after a period of rest (as determined by the GM).

The GM may rule on recovery for short periods of rest to recover about one MP per hour per Rank in the Magical Power Skill.
