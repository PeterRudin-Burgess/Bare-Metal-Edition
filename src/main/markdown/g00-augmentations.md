rework old adrenal/mental focus to wok more like spell skills

## NOTICE

> [11:13 AM] Terefang: @Peter R is it possible to discuss that BME will drop the adrenal/mental focus skills and replace that with an appendix called "augmentation powers" ?

> [11:15 AM] Terefang: ... the reason behind that is that those skills are a real oddball in the system and have multiple very opinionated resolution mechanics.

> [11:20 AM] Terefang: ... it may make sense to drop the optinionated mechanics and make them work more like spell-skills but powered by expending body development (ie. hit points)

> [11:22 AM] Terefang: ... this could also form the basis for extensions like chi-powers which may run of a chi-power development skill.

> [11:31 AM] Peter R: Yes, all in favour

> [11:31 AM] Terefang: example (from the top of my head):
> 
> Augmentation: Speed -- the character may expend 1 hit-point per rank each round to choose among the following benefits for that round:
>  * get 1 additional AP
>  * get +5 to initiative

> [11:32 AM] Peter R: I think that they are verging on super powers

> [11:32 AM] Peter R: I would like them to work in Tiers if possible, rather like talents, but in a super powers appendix that a GM can implement or not.

> [11:32 AM] Terefang: something adrenaline based --- you should not be able to break physical laws

> [11:34 AM] Terefang: super-powers will break physical laws -- basic augmentation should not

> [11:35 AM] Terefang: and having augmentation to rely on the spending of hit-points makes it a mundane thing

> [11:37 AM] Terefang: an extension to augmentation could be chi-powers that have their own power-development skill and could bend physical laws

> [11:37 AM] Peter R: But, yes, I am happy to cut them out of skills.

> [11:39 AM] Terefang: so there is the distinction:
> * augmentation will never break nor bend physical laws ... (think Captain America)
> * chi-powers should be able to bend but never break physical laws
> * super-power can do whatever they want

> [11:40 AM] Peter R: OK, that looks coherent and organised

> [11:41 AM] Terefang: it also opens up the path for monk-style archetypes

> [11:43 AM] Terefang: like -- warrior monk (only augmentation), monk (not mentalist but chi), fantastic monk (super-powered)

> [11:45 AM] Terefang: since the implied system already is like spell-skills, a "magic monk" or "clerical monk" is not bound to use different resolution techniques but only another power-source

> [11:53 AM] Peter R: I like the logic

## OLD RULES FART

### Mental

###### Mental Focus [Sd, Pr,Em]

There are several Mental Focus skills and they all need developing separately. Mental Focus skills require a combat 
round, or 5 seconds to prepare before they are used. In some cases to a combat round is required to recover from 
using a mental focus skill. During the preparation or recover round the character takes a -20 penalty to all actions. 
Before initiative is rolled in the following round the character rolls their Mental Focus skill to see if they 
succeeded. Once a Mental Focus state has been achieved it may be maintained for additional rounds but the skill 
must be retested each subsequent round at a cumulative -10 per round.

**Mental Focus: Speed** gives the character an additional 4 Action Points per round and in addition the number of 
ranks in Mental Focus: Speed may be added to their initiative roll.

**Mental Focus: Strength** gives the character an additional +15 strength bonus, which would be added to any skill 
tests using strength for the duration. Skills that have strength listed more than once as a stat bonus will benefit 
from multiple +15 bonuses. 

> Example: Melee attacks use St+St+Ag as their stat bonus. In this case the bonus from Mental Focus: Strength would be +30.

**Mental Focus: Calm** gives a character a +15 bonus that may be applied once per round to either Agility bonus or 
Self Discipline bonus, but not both in the same round. Where the bonus is to be applied is declared before the roll 
is made but can be moved with every successful skill test.

###### Mental Focus: Defense [Sd, Pr,Qu]

**Mental Focus: Defense** allows a character to focus their mind on sensing and avoiding attacks. The character cannot 
be encumbered, they must not have any net maneuver penalty from either armor, excessive equipment or injury. 
A successful Mental Focus: Defense skill test is made before initiative is rolled and on success the number of ranks 
in Mental Focus: Defense is added to the characters Defensive Bonus for the entire round. As with all Mental Focus 
skills one combat round is required to prepare and during that round the character has -20 on all actions. 
Mental Focus: Defense can be maintained for multiple rounds but each subsequent round incurs a cumulative -10 penalty 
to the skill roll.
