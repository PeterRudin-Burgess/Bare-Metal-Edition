## Creature Types

* Aberration -- An aberration has a bizarre anatomy, strange abilities, an alien mindset, or any combination of the three.
* Beast	-- Beasts are nonhumanoid creatures that are a natural part of the ecology. Most are unintelligent and lack any society or language.
* Construct -- A construct is an animated object or artificially created creature.
* Dragon -- A dragon is a reptile-like creature, usually winged, with magical or unusual abilities.
* Fey -- A fey is a creature with supernatural abilities and connections to nature or to some other force or place.
* Humanoid -- A humanoid usually has a human-like shape, most can speak and usually have well-developed societies.
* Monstrosity -- Monstrosities are monsters in the strictest senseâ€”frightening creatures that are not ordinary, not truly natural, and almost never benign. 
* Ooze -- An ooze is an amorphous or mutable creature, usually mindless.
* Outsider (Celestial, Elemental, Fiend) -- An outsider is at least partially composed of the essence of (or native to) some other non-material plane. 
* Plant -- This type comprises vegetable creatures; even though plants are alive, they are objects, not creatures.
* Undead -- Undead are once-living creatures animated by spiritual or supernatural forces.
* Vermin -- This type includes insects, arachnids, other arthropods, worms, and similar invertebrates.

## Creature Roles

* Artillery -- A creature which does area damage from a distance, such as a grenadier or a ranged heavy robot.
* Brute -- A creature focuses on raw melee power, smashing its foes to the ground, such as a great ferocious beast or a mighty robot.
* Expert -- A creature whose focus is not combat, such as a medic, engineer, or pilot.
* Ninja -- A fast, mobile melee creature, able to attack quickly and accurately and dance around its opponents.
* Skirmisher -- A fast, mobile, ranged creature, weak in melee, but able to keep its distance and pick off its targets from afar. Many gun-toting bandits are skirmishers.
* Support -- A creature which heals or buffs other creatures, or alters the battlefield; this could be a specialist support robot, or an adept commander.
