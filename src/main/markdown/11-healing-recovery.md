# Healing and Revovery

## Healing

In addition to the various technological and special power means of restoring Hit Points, a character will recover 
1 #hit per hour of uninterrupted rest. Four weeks of rest will return a character to maximum #hits regardless of how 
many #hits the character has lost.

## Recovery

For wounds that cause injuries and penalties this will heal by reducing the penalty by -5 per day. When the penalty is 
completely removed the wound is healed. Wounds heal starting with the lowest penalty and progressing to more serious 
injuries last. Penalties are healed sequentially and one must be completely healed before another starts.

> Example: Joe has picked up two wounds. The first gives a penalty of -10 and the other a -15.
> After two days the first wound has recovered by Jo still has the -15 penalty.
> A further 3 days are required for Jo to be completely recovered.
