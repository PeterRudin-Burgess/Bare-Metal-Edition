# TODO -- auto generation

[6:55 PM] Terefang: @✍Peter R have you considered using RMSS/FRP format for the Critical Tables ? ... like separating out the Status Effects from the text ?
...
[7:00 PM] Terefang: this kind of table layout is not supported by markdown, but i think i can write a lua script that does the heavy lifting ...
[7:06 PM] ✍Peter R: I hadn't, because I don't particularly like them
[7:07 PM] ✍Peter R: They are less readable, and until you know all the symbols they leave you tied to the books
[7:09 PM] Terefang: yes the symbols are bad and need explanation ... i would have used H for hits, B for Bleeding per round; S for rounds of Stun; UP ... unable to parry
[7:10 PM] Terefang: ... is there "must parry" ?
[7:11 PM] ✍Peter R: I didn't use must parry, it caused a lot of confusion when people were stunned cannot parry and stunned must parry
[7:11 PM] ✍Peter R: so I cheated and didn't use either
[7:11 PM] ✍Peter R: It is also awkward for ranged weapons, when you cannot parry
[7:13 PM] Terefang: hmm ... "+5H | +1B | 4S" is that readable ?
[7:15 PM] Terefang: maybe using only the modifier for Penalty eg. "+5H | +1B | 4S | -50"
[7:16 PM] ✍Peter R: What is the B?
[7:16 PM] Terefang: Bleeding
[7:16 PM] ✍Peter R: ah
[7:17 PM] Terefang: may using "St" for stun
[7:17 PM] Terefang: ?
[7:18 PM] ✍Peter R: I can see how from an auto generation point of view that would be easy to implement
[7:18 PM] Terefang: also ... you can separate text and effect generation
[7:19 PM] ✍Peter R: yes
[7:19 PM] ✍Peter R: As long as we avoid icons
[7:19 PM] ✍Peter R: They are obtuse
[7:19 PM] Terefang: i have had my share of icons in Genesys ... dont want them anymore
[7:20 PM] ✍Peter R: good
[7:23 PM] Terefang: i have made a calculation
[7:24 PM] Terefang: ... each crit table has 21 rows plus 1 header row
[7:25 PM] Terefang: ... using A4 595x842 with a 50 margin means 495x742
[7:25 PM] ✍Peter R: yes, basically it is 5% steps plus 66
[7:27 PM] Terefang: ... make each row 35 high 21*35 = 735; so the header row has 742-735 = 7 points of space left
[7:28 PM] Terefang: ... make each row 34 high 21*34 = 714; so the header row has 742-714 = 28 points of space left
[7:29 PM] ✍Peter R: 34 high and a 1pt border per cell.
[7:29 PM] ✍Peter R: I had to manually juggle the sizes because of the amount of text
[7:30 PM] ✍Peter R: 'Strike to leg +4 hits' was easy, 'Foe falls to the ground engulfed in flames, foes dies in 6 rounds of agony' takes a little more room.
[7:31 PM] Terefang: the spaciest entry is some
...
[7:31 PM] Terefang: it is 38pts high in 8pt font
[7:32 PM] ✍Peter R: That looks quite good
[7:32 PM] ✍Peter R: very good
[7:33 PM] Terefang: so if we condense to "+22H | 2St | -75" that leaves "Hit to foe's knee. Bones shattered. Foe dies in 2 rounds"
[7:36 PM] Terefang: another two ...
...
[7:39 PM] Terefang: the texts could be condensed to almost 50% of the original ....
[7:41 PM] Terefang: and 3*8 = 24 pts ... with some padding 30? and i calculated 34-35 pts per row ... it does not save whitespace ... but a crit-table is full-page anyway
[7:43 PM] ✍Peter R: True
