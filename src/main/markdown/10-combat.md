# Combat

Personal Combat is defined as any battle between two or more characters (player and/or non-player) that takes place 
using Melee or Missile Attacks as well as Maneuvers,  Meditations and Gifts.

When a combat starts Initiative is rolled for each combatant, or group of combatants. Initiative decides the order in 
which the characters act.

Each action has a cost in Action Points (See 9.1) and each character has 4AP to spend each round.

The group with the lowest Initiative declares their actions first, and then the next lowest until all actions have 
been declared.

Actions are resolved from Highest initiative to the lowest. A character may choose to act later in the initiative order 
but they cannot move before their turn.

Once all the characters in the combat have acted a new combat round starts.

Initiative is rolled once per combat, not per round.

When a character has their turn they may choose to make any combination of actions and attacks. Once an attack is made 
it is resolved and any effects are applied immediately.

## Rolling Initiative

Each PC rolls their own initiative by rolling d100 and adding their total Quickness [Qu] bonus to the roll. 
A higher initiative is better than a low initiative.

## Making an Attack

To make an attack the player makes a d100 roll and adds their characters weapon skill to the roll plus any situational 
modifiers. The GM deducts any penalties such as the defenders Defensive Bonus and any cover. The final result is 
compared to an attack table cross referencing the defenders armor and the total roll. The result gives a number 
of points of damage and a possible letter that describes a specific wound. The wounds are called Criticals and are 
graded A to E and a type such as S for slashing wounds or B for burns. A result would look something like 20AS for 
20 hits of damage and an A grade Slashing wound.

Krush is used in place of Crush to save confusion when the result would be a ‘C’ severity, CK not CC.

A second d100 roll is made on the matching critical table to find the actual effects of the attack.

There are different attack tables for different weapons to give them unique strengths and weaknesses.

## Maneuvers in Combat

A character may make maneuvers in combat such as running or diving for cover. Each character may move their Base Move 
(BM) per round with no need to make any rolls unless the movement is opposed. You cannot just choose to move past an 
armed guard that you are fighting. The opposition is simply assumed and the move would fail.

To move more than your BM requires you to use AP. 1AP allows you to move your BM in the combat round at that point. 

> Example: You may spend 1AP on movement to close the distance with a target. Spending AP on movement in addition to
> the free move each round.

You may also make specific maneuvers in a round such as leaping off a balcony or trying to swing from a cable hanging 
from a gantry.

If your maneuver roll was successful then you have completed the maneuver. If the maneuver result was less than 100% the
GM may decide on the outcome. Either the maneuver is not completed or the maneuver gives a penalty to your next action.

> Example 1: You are trying to chase an escaping villain. You want to get to a door first and slam it shut. The GM 
> gives you a difficulty penalty to out run the fleeing figure. You make your roll and the result is only 80%. The GM
> decides you did not make it to the door in time.

> Example 2: You want to leap off a cargo container on to two security guards below. You make a maneuver to jump down
> gaining surprise on the guards. You make the roll and get 80%. The GM decides your attack on the guard will be at -20
> due to you being slightly off balance from your landing.

> Example 3: You want to try and make it behind some cover as the security forces open fire on you. Your attempt to
> sprint for cover results in a roll of 80%. Rather than having your still out in the open until the following round
> the GM gives one of the security forces a single shot at you at +20 but if you survive you will start the round
> behind cover.

## Parrying

Parrying refers to any decision to favor defense over offence. It does not require you to have a weapon or to make 
physical contact with your attacker. Examples of parrying could be a blade on blade sword fight, martial artists 
blocking blows, ducking and diving behind furniture or throwing dust into your attackers eyes. Any form of dodging 
or evading counts as parrying.

Obviously you cannot dodge something moving at the speed of light, but you can evade the shooters aim.

You can only parry attacks you can see being aimed at you.

To parry you deduct a proportion of your Offensive Bonus and add it to your Defensive Bonus.

Parry is assigned specific foes. If you are fighting two security guards you could attack with half your Offensive Bonus 
[OB] and divide the other half equally between your two assailants.

> Example: You have a +80 OB. You can add +20 to your DB against both assailants and still attack with +40OB.

Parrying hand to hand weapons and attacks 1 point of Offensive Bonus [OB] becomes 1 point of Defensive Bonus [DB].

Parrying missile and projectile weapons 2 points of OB becomes 1 point of DB.

Parrying energy weapons 4 points of OB becomes 1 point of DB.

You cannot parry if you are constrained and cannot move.

## Resolving Attacks

When a character makes an attack, as stated above you make an open-ended roll (upwards only), add in any Offensive 
Bonuses and deduct any Defensive Bonuses. You then cross reference the result on the correct weapon table.

A result will look something like 38ES.

The 38 is the number of #hits that the target receives. 

The E is the severity of the critical. Normal criticals fall in the A to E range with A being less severe and E being 
much more lethal.

The S in this case means Slash. This is the type of critical. There are many different types of critical. Each has a 
single letter abbreviation.

| Code | Critical Table |
|:------:|:---------------------------------------------|
| F	| Fire/Burn |
| I	| Impact |
| K	| Krush |
| P	| Puncture |
| S	| Slash |
| U	| Unbalance |

Once you know the critical type and severity a second d100 roll is made and cross referenced with the correct critical table.

Criticals have a wound description and additional damage. The additional damage could be bleeding or burning described 
as #hits/round. A one off addition to the damage delivered. A character may be stunned for a number of rounds or may 
suffer a specific injury. The most severe wounds can kill a character instantly.

The UM66 row on the criticals tables is only used if the unmodified critical roll is a 66.

## Results over 150

If the total attack roll is greater than 150, for every 10 points over the 150 you add 1 to the critical roll.

## #Hits of Damage

A character has hit points or #hits equal to their total Physique skill. When they have 0 #hits remaining they will 
fall unconscious unless they can make a Self Discipline Resistance Test. Roll d100 and add your SD stat to the roll. 
Deduct the number of #hits they are below zero. If the total roll is 101 or greater they have remained conscious for 
the current combat round. A SD Resistance Test is required every round. One failure will leave a character unconscious.

## Bleeding and Burning

A character that is bleeding or burning will take a number of #hits of damage every round until they either apply a 
medical kit, bandage, staunch or tourniquet the wound or in the case of burning, they smother or drop and roll. 
Staunching a wound or applying pressure will halve the amount of damage being taken each round.

A tourniquet will stop all bleeding from a wound. A bandage will stop up to 5#hits/round of bleeding.

## Stunned

A character that is stunned only gets half their normal number of AP per round. They may not use any concentration 
based maneuvers or maintain any concentration gifts or meditations.

Stun normally lasts for a number of rounds. Once the stun has passed the character has no lasting effects.

Stun does accumulate. If you are stunned for 3 rounds and then hit again stunning your for a further 3 rounds you are 
now stunned for 6 rounds.

If the total number of rounds of stun exceeds the number or ranks in Physique you have you will black out until you are
completely unstunned.

## Death and Dying

If a critical says that you will die you are assumed to be down and incapacitated until death occurs. You may take no 
action beyond speaking, shouting or screaming until death takes you. Your companions may attempt to save you and 
prevent your death.
