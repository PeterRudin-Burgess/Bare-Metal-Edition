##### Expert

Experts range from street thieves and scoundrils to nobles and diplomats and 
adventurous storytellers. Some choose the ability to handle any social situation,
others use stealthy skills allowing them to avoid unwanted entanglements, and 
others delve into field-research rather than a laboratory or classroom.
