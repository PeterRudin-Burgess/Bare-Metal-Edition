##### Savant

Either scholar, mystic, wizard, sorcerer, shaman, psychic, or clergyman, 
the savant specializes in studies, arts, as well as the divine or the 
supernatural. Their knowledge and insight as well as their command of 
various powers are known and respected. Whether part of society, savants
are a special breed apart from normal mortals.
