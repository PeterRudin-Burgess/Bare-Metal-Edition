## 3.0 Ancestry/Species

An ancestry (or species) is defined using Talents and Flaws. 
Each ancestry receives a net 15 points to spend on Talents; 
additional points may be gained and spent by taking a Flaw. 
Talents have a point cost, and Flaws have a negative point costs, 
they give you points back that you can spend on more talents. 
See chapter 4.0 for a list of Talents and Flaws.

### Mixed Ancestry/Species

Most species have a dominant Talent where they have two tiers 
and a regressive Talent where they have a single tier. Some species 
will have genetic Flaws that confer a penalty, but these are balanced 
by having additional Talents. If you want to create mixed heritage 
species, you may mix the Talents and flaws from the two ‘parents’. 
You may have no more tiers in a Talent than either parent possessed, 
you may only choose blood Talents that the parents possessed, and you 
may only take a net of 15 points in Talents in total.
