> **Race Creation Example**
>
> Stephen wants to create a unique race for his character. 
> The concept is that in the years before faster than light 
> travel was discovered, humans first explored space using 
> generation ships. The crews that left Earth knew they would 
> never return, and it was the descendants of those crews that 
> would eventually reach their destinations. This new race is 
> a derivative of humans that were separated for thousands of 
> years within a generation ship that eventually stumbled upon 
> a star system that had been colonized millennia after the 
> generation ship had left earth.
>
> Stephen goes on to flesh out more details of what makes this
> species unique and different to standard humans. He calls the
> species ‘First Wave Humans’ as they consider themselves the
> first wave of human expansion.
>
> This race of spaceship confined humans gains one tier in
> Enhanced Hearing +5 to Perception Skill Tests and +10 to Self Discipline.
