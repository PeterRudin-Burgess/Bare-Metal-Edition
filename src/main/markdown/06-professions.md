# Professions

Professions are represent using two features. The first is a unique set of 
Professional skills

Each profession has its own set of skill costs that reflect the profession’s 
strengths and weaknesses.

Each character may select ten skills from across all categories in which to 
specialize. These allow a player to refine and personalize their character. 
These are the characters ‘Preferred Skills’. For more on skills is 
chapter 7.0 Skills.

Skill Costs are listed in the format x/X with a lower and a higher cost. 
The first time the skill is bought, at each level, the lower cost is paid. 
Each time after the first time, the higher cost is used. Intensively training 
a skill is very expensive in development points. A skill with the same number 
on both sides of the oblique e.g. 3/3 means that every rank will cost 3 DP.

> **Example:** If Riding: Horse cost 2/4, buying one rank would cost 2 DP.
> Buying two ranks would cost 6DP (2+4), buying three ranks would cost 10DP (2+4+4).

## Secondary Skills

Secondary skills are potentially infinite and very much dependent on setting 
and character background. They can be as varied as Anthropology to Weaving.

Rather than buying a great many skills to try and describe a character’s 
particular background, many secondary skills can be covered by a single 
skill called Vocation.

Vocation always has an attached specialism such as Vocation:  Diplomat. 
In this instance, most day to day tasks relating to diplomacies such as 
knowing the correct forms of address or the way that embassy bureaucracy 
operates would all be tested using the single skill.

Skills that have a direct impact on core areas of the game such as Combat, 
Maneuvers or Psionics should not be rolled into Vocations but created as 
distinct secondary skills.

> **Example:** A character has Vocation:  Thief.
>
> The vocation skill allows them to take an impression of a key so they can
> make a copy later but not to crack a safe as that would be a significant
> static maneuver.
 
The vocation skill costs 2/4 for all professions, and a character may have
several different vocation skills to best reflect their prior history and
learning. The GM will need to assign three stats to be used with vocations
on a case by case basis.


All secondary skills cost 2/4 for all professions. As a GM you do not need 
to define all the possible secondary skills before play starts. If a player 
tells you they want to study to become a Computer Hacker, you could make 
them buy Technical: Computer or decide that Hacking is a definite skill in 
its own right. In that case, you add it to the list of available Secondary 
Skills. The cost will be 2/4 and the three stat bonuses will be the same as 
the closest core skill unless you decide that others will be more suitable. 
The skill will always have three stat bonuses.

## Creating Your Own Professions

It is expected that you will create your own professions. All professions 
receive 50 development points of skill ranks or talents as basic training. 

Each profession also has a unique set of skill costs.

* All skills that are absolutely core to the profession are costed at 1/3.
* Skills that are important to the profession are costed at 2/4.
* Skills that are outside the professions realm are costed at 5/7.
* Skills that are alien to the profession are costed at 7/10.
* Skills that are restricted to specific professions are costed at 12/15.

Although this skill has a cost, it cannot be bought without the GM’s 
express permission.

## Example Professions 

### Aristocrat

Aristocrats are the galactic senators, planetary nobles, military officers, 
and any other of thousands of beings that make their way in the galaxy 
through force of personality.

They can also be con-artists, gamblers or grifters. Whether genuine or 
ignoble, the Aristocrat specializes in using their silver tongue to help 
them survive. They inspire allies, intimidate enemies, and talk their way 
into, or out of, almost anything. 

Because of their unique skill set, Aristocrats often play a support role 
in a party of galactic explorers. They are rarely frontline fighters, 
although in the case of Aristocrats with military backgrounds, they may 
often surround themselves with soldiers and Assistants who they command 
with deadly efficiency.

### Armsman

Call them bounty hunters, bodyguards, or soldiers of fortune — they all fall 
into the Armsman category. These are the men and women specializing in all 
types of combat. Clad in Heavy Armor and armed with the latest technology 
and weapons, they live (and die) by the laser and whatever else they can use 
to fight with.

More than any other class, the Armsman relies on her equipment as she 
explores the stars. With the latest technology, she’s able to defend her 
companions from the deadliest threats from across the universe. Armsmen are 
capable of using any piece of military technology and they don’t hesitate 
to do so. They’re an asset to any party and are often the vanguard of 
battle, and that’s just how they like it!

**Professional Skills:**

*Move in Armor  	2,

### Mystic

The Mystic is an exotic being who has tapped into mysterious power 
unfathomable by most others. Whether they’re little green gnomes with 
powerful magic or human psychics, the Mystic reflects a more peaceful, 
introspective, and thoughtful being than is usually found in the galaxy 
at large. That is not to say that Mystics are pacifists. Many are trained 
in the ways of war, though it is not their first course of action. They 
would much prefer to rely on their exotic abilities than a laser pistol, 
but pragmatism demands adaptation.
