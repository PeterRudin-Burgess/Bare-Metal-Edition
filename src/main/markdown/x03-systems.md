# Optional Resolution Systems

## Difficulties

Some GMs may find it hard to establish modifiers for skill rolls and fresh GMs in particular may struggle with 
the OSR nature of the core ruleset. For those we present here a pre-established table of modifiers which should 
only be taken as a generic guideline.

| Type           | Modifier | Threshold | Partial Success |
|:---------------|:--------:|:---------:|:---------:|
| Very Easy       |    +30   |     70+   |     50+   |
| Easy            |    +15   |     85+   |     65+   |
| Normal          |     +0   |    100+   |     75+   |
| Hard            |    -15   |    115+   |     90+   |
| Very Hard       |    -30   |    130+   |    100+   |
| Near Impossible |    -50   |    150+   |    115+   |

### Partial Success (Option)

If it is possible for an action to have a partial success, 
the GM may rule that the PC acceived upto to 50% of the intended action 
and may try again after some time of reorientation.

| Mythic         |   -125   |    225+   |    170+   |

## Take 50

If the PCs are not in a hurry -- instead of rolling the dice -- they can take 50
and add all the usualy modifiers for a final result.

### Passive Checks (Option)

Whenever the PCs are not actively using a skill, 
they are assumed to "Take 50"
and the GM can quickly rule on a result.
