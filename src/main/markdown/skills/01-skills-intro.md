# Skills

Skills are the core way in which characters differentiate themselves. Two Armsman may have wildly different skill 
sets with one preferring concealed weapons and training in observation as a bodyguard and another trained in the 
heavy armor and weapons of a space marine.

There are four types of skills. Simple Skills, Combat Expertise Skills, Combat Skills and Psionic skills. 
Any skill marked with a CE is a Combat Expertise.

Simple skills may be used in two ways. The first is a straight test of skill where an open ended roll is made, the 
skill total is added to the roll and difficulty factors are subtracted. If the result is 100+ the skill test succeeds. 
Skills may also be used as subject knowledge. Having a skill in Music: flute would allow you to play the flute but it 
would also allow you to recognize a quality instrument and to make simple repairs and carry out maintenance. 

Combat expertise skills can only be used to reduce penalties. The most common is Move in Armor. As armor may be 
restrictive and encumbering, this skill reflects the training in using armor effectively and reduces the encumbrance 
penalties associated with using armor. There could be an infinite number of combat expertise skills such as using two 
weapons at the same time, or fighting while blind using your other senses. These should be discussed between GM and 
player before buying the skill.

Combat Skills do not use the 101+ success or failure mechanic. Combat skills use an open ended roll, plus skill total 
and any other bonuses and any penalties are deducted. The final result is compared to a combat table and the result 
of the attack is read off the table. A better combat skill roll will do more damage than a poor skill roll even if 
both attacks hit their target.

Psionic skills use special rules that are explained in the chapter 10.0 Psionics, see page 42.

## Skill Bonuses

Skills are designed to give diminishing returns. Simple Skills, Combat Expertise Skills, Combat Skills all use this 
tailing off of benefits.

* The first 10 ranks in a skill give a +5 skill bonus per rank.
* The second 10 ranks in the skill gives +2 bonus per rank.
* The third 10 ranks in the skill gives +1 bonus per rank.
* All ranks beyond the 30th rank give a +0.5 bonus per rank (rounded down).

If you have no ranks in a skill you may still attempt it at your GMâ€™s discretion. Some things are simply not possible 
without some training. For example, without some basic knowledge developing a vaccine for an alien disease is simply 
not possible regardless of how well you roll. Such unskilled attempts are made with a skill bonus of -25 although you 
may still apply Stat bonuses which may reduce that penalty.	If you have a related skill the GM may allow you to use 
some or all of your related skill bonus. If you are skilled in playing the flute and are confronted with an alien 
musical instrument that is still woodwind in principle then the GM may allow you to use your flute skill but apply 
a substantial difficulty factor. If the instrument was more like a guitar then this is much less similar but the 
principles of reading music or following a tune remain the same. The GM may allow you to use the number ranks you 
have in flute as your skill bonus plus your stats for playing such a different instrument.

## Professional Skills

Each character may select 10 specific skills to be their professional skills. Some GMs may have already designated up 
to five of these for you. If you had Weapon1:Laser Pistol and Weapon2:Laser Rifle despite them both being lasers they 
would count as different skills. The same would apply to different musical instruments or regions of local knowledge.

Once a skill is chosen the character gains +2 skill bonus for every rank the character knows in that specific skill 
up a maximum of +40.

## Adding New Skills

The skills presented here are only a tiny proportion of all the skills that GMs may want to use. If you want to run a 
game of futuristic espionage you may want to expand the number of skills for that genre. At the moment the skills are 
intended to cover multiple situations. For example the Climbing skill would also cover abseiling and rappelling as 
well as climbing. These skills could easily be broken out to create new skills.

You may also want to create specialisms. For example there is at present only one Pick Locks skill but that could be 
easily turned into two or more skills such as Pick Locks: Mechanical and Pick Locks: Electronic.

For completely new skills the costs must be set for each profession in play. New Combat Expertise skills may be 
introduced to reflect special training.

> Example: Combat Awareness CE could reduce the penalty for making perception skill tests using less than the normal number of Action Points.

There is a ladder of skill costs. You decide the relationship between the skill and the profession.

|||
|:---:|:-------------------------------|
| 1/2| |
| 1/3|  A core skill|
| 2/2| |
| 2/3| |
| 2/4|   A related skill|
| 3/4| |
| 3/5|   The basic cost for all skills|
| 4/6| |
| 5/7|   A skill that is unusual for the profession|
| 6/8| |
| 7/10|  The skill is totally alien to the profession|
| 9/12| |
| 12/15| Restricted|

Between each base cost (1/3, 2/4, 3/5 etc.) are unused costs. These are used for further differentiation. For example, 
if you created a Special Forces profession and wanted to differentiate it from the regular Armsman you could cost 
Survival and Ambush/Sniper skills one step cheaper than the Armsman while compensating by making Forgery and Pick Locks 
one step more expensive.

Not every skill has to have different costs for every rank. A skill could be listed as 1/1 which means that a character 
can buy an unlimited number of ranks for 1DP each

## Stat Bonuses

Stat bonuses are added together and then added to the total skill bonus. Most skills use three stats. The stat names 
have been abbreviated in the following form.

*Constitution [Co], 
Agility [Ag], 
Strength [St], 
Quickness [Qu],
Self Discipline [Sd], 
Reasoning [Re], 
Memory[Me], 
Presence [Pr], 
Intuition [In], 
and Empathy [Em].*
