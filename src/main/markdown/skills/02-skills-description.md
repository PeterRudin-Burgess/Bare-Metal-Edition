## Skill Descriptions

### Combat

###### Move In Armor CE [St, Ag, Co]

This skill reduces the penalties incurred for using bulky and restricting armors and suits. It can never give a bonus, 
only reduce penalties to zero.

###### Combat Expertise (CE) [varies]

Combat Expertise skills are used to reduce penalties. Common CE skills are fighting with two weapons at the same time 
such as two swords, or sword and dagger or two pistols. Another option is to make an additional attack in the same 
round, popular with martial artists.

###### Weapon 1 [St, Ag, Ag] ranged/[St, St, Ag] melee

This is your primary weapon. The same skill cost applies to all weapons of the same form factor. 
All pistols would use the same price, although they would need to be developed independently. 
Once you know a weapon you know how to use it in all its configurations. 
If you know Knife you can stab and slash with it but also throw it. 
When thrown it incurs range penalties but uses your full skill.

###### Weapon 2 [St, Ag, Ag] ranged/[St, St, Ag] melee

This is a second weapon type. This is at a slightly higher price as it is not your core focus.

###### Weapon 3 [St, Ag, Ag] ranged/[St, St, Ag] melee

A tertiary weapon skill. All additional weapons pay this price. If you knew Blaster Pistol (Weapon 1), 
Auto Blaster [Weapon 2] and Heavy Blaster [Weapon 3] you could still learn RPG Launcher and it would 
cost the same as Weapon 3.

> Note: Heavy Weapons: Starships use Heavy Weapons. Heavy Weapons may be taken as one of your weapon skills.
> There are several different types of heavy weapon, and each has to be developed as a separate skill.
> E.g. Heavy Laser, Ion Chargers and Proton Missiles

### General

###### Acrobatics/Tumbling [Ag, Qu,Sd]

A successful skill roll can reduce the damage from falling by reducing the fall attack roll by -20. When a character 
is flying under a meditation or mystic gift, Acrobatics/Tumbling skill may be used with a -20 modifier for performing airborne maneuvers.

###### Climbing [St, Ag, Co]

This skill allows you to climb, with or without equipment, walls and rock faces. Extended climbs may require several 
climbing skill checks.

###### Music [In, Ag, Sd]

This skill is used for both composition and performance. Each instrument should be developed as a separate skill. If 
more than one musical skill is known, such as singing and guitar, the higher of the two skills is used for testing a 
performance.

###### Swimming [St, Ag, Sd]

A single rank in swimming is barely enough to keep you afloat and characters with no ranks in swimming simply cannot swim.

###### Riding [Ag, Co, Em]

Riding is used when riding an animal. It may be bought multiple times for use with different animals such as horse, 
camel, elephant. Similar animals may use the same skill but with increased difficulty such as horse, mule and donkey. Flying mounts still use this skill. For mounted combat a successful riding roll is required each combat round to have sufficient control to be able to fight.

###### Trickery [Ag, Re, In]

This skill is used for slight of hand and misdirection. It can be used for performing card tricks or small acts of 
theft, typically pick pocketing.

###### Pick Locks [In, Ag, Sd]

This skill is used for both electronic and mechanical locks. The quality of the lock will affect the difficulty but 
also the amount of time and damage the lock picker is prepared to do to the lock. It is easier to pick a lock if you 
are not worried about leaving marks or even smashing the face-plate off to get to the innards.

###### Stalk/Hide [Ag, Sd, Em]

This skill is used for moving silently or hiding effectively when stationary. The conditions such as cover and 
lighting all affect the difficulty.

###### Perception [In, Re, Em]

Possibly one of the most important skills in the game! Perception is used to see if your characters sees, hears or 
feels anything significant. If the character is ‘passive’, i.e. not actively listening or searching, the GM rolls 
the characters perception skill tests and then works the result into the game narrative. If the player states that 
they are actively searching, listening or trying to detect something then the player may make the skill test.

###### Driving [In, Em, Ag]

This skill covers anything that has some sort of surface effect. That includes marine vehicles, hovercraft, wheeled 
or even grav-bikes or sleds. The skill should be developed separately for each type of vehicle such as marine or 
hovercraft. Different designs of vehicle with a type only impose difficulty factors if the character is unfamiliar 
with them e.g. a character familiar with grav-sleds suddenly finds herself on a grav-bike would suffer higher 
difficulties due to lack of familiarity with the handling and controls.

###### Ambush/Sniper [In, Re, Qu]

Ambush and sniper need to be developed separately and for each weapon. When attempting to ambush a foe the attacker 
must be unobserved or the foe unaware. The ambush roll skill check is made and on a success the critical rolled may 
be adjusted up or down by the number of ranks in Ambush with that weapon. The result may not be adjusted to a ‘66’ 
result. If the target is active, such as moving fast or is in combat then only half the number of ranks may be used 
to adjust the critical result. Ambush is only to be used with Melee weapons, Sniper is used with ranged weapons that 
use a direct line of sight. These skills can be used with meditations if they meet the criteria of a direct physical 
attack.

###### Languages [Me, Re, Em]

Languages are bought separately for spoken and written usage. A standard skill test is used to see if the listener or 
reader understands the communication. The number of ranks limits the sophistication of the vocabulary known. One rank 
gives just the barest basics. 6 ranks [+30 skill] gives a functioning vocabulary for everyday use. Most people are 
considered to have 10 ranks in their own language in both spoken and written, although academics may have many more. 

###### Physique [Co, Sd, St]

Physique is to be considered one of the essential skills. Physique is literally strength and conditioning training and 
the skill confers additional hit points, to the character. Hit points are referred to a #Hits as a standard 
abbreviation in the combat tables, meaning number of hit points of damage the character has taken.

### Mental

###### Mental Focus [Sd, Pr,Em]

There are several Mental Focus skills and they all need developing separately. Mental Focus skills require a combat 
round, or 5 seconds to prepare before they are used. In some cases to a combat round is required to recover from 
using a mental focus skill. During the preparation or recover round the character takes a -20 penalty to all actions. 
Before initiative is rolled in the following round the character rolls their Mental Focus skill to see if they 
succeeded. Once a Mental Focus state has been achieved it may be maintained for additional rounds but the skill 
must be retested each subsequent round at a cumulative -10 per round.

**Mental Focus: Speed** gives the character an additional 4 Action Points per round and in addition the number of 
ranks in Mental Focus: Speed may be added to their initiative roll.

**Mental Focus: Strength** gives the character an additional +15 strength bonus, which would be added to any skill 
tests using strength for the duration. Skills that have strength listed more than once as a stat bonus will benefit 
from multiple +15 bonuses. 

> Example: Melee attacks use St+St+Ag as their stat bonus. In this case the bonus from Mental Focus: Strength would be +30.

**Mental Focus: Calm** gives a character a +15 bonus that may be applied once per round to either Agility bonus or 
Self Discipline bonus, but not both in the same round. Where the bonus is to be applied is declared before the roll 
is made but can be moved with every successful skill test.

###### Mental Focus: Defense [Sd, Pr,Qu]

**Mental Focus: Defense** allows a character to focus their mind on sensing and avoiding attacks. The character cannot 
be encumbered, they must not have any net maneuver penalty from either armor, excessive equipment or injury. 
A successful Mental Focus: Defense skill test is made before initiative is rolled and on success the number of ranks 
in Mental Focus: Defense is added to the characters Defensive Bonus for the entire round. As with all Mental Focus 
skills one combat round is required to prepare and during that round the character has -20 on all actions. 
Mental Focus: Defense can be maintained for multiple rounds but each subsequent round incurs a cumulative -10 penalty 
to the skill roll.

###### Forgery [Ag, Re, In]

This skill is used for creating forgeries of objects or documents. It is assumed that the correct tools are available 
and if not, this should be reflected in the difficulty factor of the skill test.

###### Survival [Re, Me, In]

This skill encompasses the knowledge and practical skills needed to survive in a hostile environment. It is normally developed once for each biome such as Survival: Desert or Arctic. Trying to survive in an unfamiliar environment incurs higher difficulty penalties. This skill includes foraging for food, building fires and rigging shelters.

by 2 to fire a ships weapons if the appropriate specific weapon skill is missing.

###### Space Pilot [In, Re, Ag]

Piloting is divided into three types, atmospheric is used for aircraft travelling through the atmosphere. Hyperspace 
piloting is for flying at faster than light speeds. Between those two extremes is normal space piloting. This skill 
is used for atmosphere piloting, achieving orbit to the point where a ship exceeds the speed of light and enters 
hyperspace. Most ship to ship combat takes place in this period of travel. 

###### Hyperspace Pilot [Re, Me, Ag]

Hyperspace pilots control their ship through faster than light travel. This skill covers successfully entering and 
leaving hyperspace.

###### Space Navigation [Re, Me, In]

This skill covers the plotting of courses through space, identifying jump points where ships need to enter or leave 
hyperspace and entering these courses into the ships computers.

###### Ship Sensors [Re, Me, In]
