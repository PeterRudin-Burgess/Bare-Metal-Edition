### Character Creation

To round out your character you can now spend 20 Development Points on skills of your choice. A starting character 
may have no more ranks in a skill than double their level plus one, meaning that a first level character cannot 
have more than four ranks in a skill (1st level +1 is 2, two doubled is 4 ranks).

The exception to this cap on ranks is languages which may be learned at any speed.

Each profession has a unique set of costs per skill.

These 20 Development points are intended to allow you to customize your character and add in any skills that their 
back story suggests they should have. As your character progresses you will gain more Development Points that can 
be used to improve skills and add new skills.

> **Character Creation Example**
> 
> Stephen wants his character to be a good all round pilot so wants to buy Combat Pilot (5DP), Hyperspace Pilot (5DP) 
> and Ship Sensors (7DP). This leaves Stephen with 3DP to spend. The last 3DP are spent on an additional rank in Perception.
> 
> To complete the skills, Stephen selects ten of the character’s skills to be his ‘prefered skills’. These receive a 
> bonus of +2 per rank for the first twenty ranks.
> 
> Stephen can now complete the skills, totaling all the rank, Stat and special bonuses.
> 
> All that is left is for Stephen to give his character a name, description and back story.
