Every character can reach a potential of 101 in every Stat.

Stat increases are covered later under 16.2 on page 80.

### Character Stats

There are ten Stats. There are four physical; 
Constitution [Co], Agility [Ag], Strength [St], Quickness [Qu]; 
and six mental; 
Self Discipline [Sd], Reasoning [Re], Memory[Me], Presence [Pr], Intuition [In], and Empathy [Em].

The convention on abbreviating the Stat names is to capitalize the first letter 
and lowercase second letter, so they become Co, Ag, St, Qu, Sd, Re, Me, Pr, In and Em.

### Unskilled Rolls

Sometimes there will be no relevant skill to cover what a character wants to achieve. 
In these situations, a normal skill roll is made, but the entire Stat is used as if 
it was a skill bonus. An example may be using Memory [Me] to try and remember some 
fact from the character’s background or using Self Discipline [Sd] to keep hold of 
a red hot poker in a rite of passage ceremony.

You can now roll your characters stats and assign them in the order that best helps 
model the character you would like.

> **Character Creation Example**
>
> Stephen is going to create a new character. Making ten d100 rolls, he gets the following numbers. 
>
> 24, 31, 43, 46, 69, 69, 82, 84, 86, 95
>
> The best result is a 95, so the option to boost the two lowest rolls to 90 does not apply. 
> Stephen assigns the rolls to this character's Stats like this. 
> The Bonuses are added into the bonus column.

## 2.2 Appearance

How a character looks has no impact on game mechanics. 
You may make a character any size, shape, gender or of 
any appearance as you see fit.

## 2.3 Defensive Bonus

A character’s Defensive Bonus [DB] is their Quickness bonus times three.
