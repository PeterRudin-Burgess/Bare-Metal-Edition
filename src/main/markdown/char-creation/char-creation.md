# 2.0 Creating a Character

## Overview

The first step in playing Bare Metal is to create a character. 
If you are going to be the GM, then you need to be au fait with 
creating characters to both be able to assist your players in 
creating their characters and so you can create the great number 
of Non-Player Characters [NPCs] that will populate your universe.

Characters are created by combining stats, that define the characters 
mental and physical characteristics; a species/ancestry that can confer 
a mix of advantages and disadvantages called talents and flaws. 
A culture confers skills common to people from that background and 
a profession. You can then customize the character by buying additional 
skills. The final stage is to add a description and background to your 
character; after that, you are ready to play. It typically takes 20 minutes 
to create a character from scratch.

## 2.1 Attributes/Stats

Each character has ten attributes that describe their physical and mental 
strengths and weaknesses. High attributes give a bonus to actions, and low 
attributes give a penalty.

For ease of use, these Attributes are shortened to ‘stats’, and the bonus 
or penalty is ‘stat bonus’.

Every skill has three stats attached to it, and the total of all the stat 
bonuses are added to the skill total before making a roll.

### Rolling Stats

When creating your character, you will make ten d100 rolls. Any result 
under 21 may be re-rolled once, but the new result must be kept.

These ten results are then assigned to the character's stats in any order 
that the player chooses.

If the character does not have any stats over 90 at this point, the two 
lowest stats can be elevated to 90. This rule only applies to Player 
Characters and important NPCs, not to normal people, who should be considered 
to be about average for most stats.

### Stat Bonuses

The stat bonus is calculated as (Stat-50)÷3. Any fractional part is discarded, 
so the number is always rounded toward zero. A stat of 100 will give a stat 
bonus of +16. A stat of 20 gives a stat bonus of -10. A truly average 
individual will have no bonuses at all, or they will tend to cancel out.

#### Temporary vs Potential

The stats you roll are your temporary stats. That is the value right now. 
Some things can reduce your temporary Stat, such as a serious wound or injury. 
You can always improve your temporary Stat and strive to achieve your true potential.
