# Ancestry/Species

An ancestry (or species) is defined using Talents and Flaws. 
Each ancestry receives a net 15 points to spend on Talents; 
additional points may be gained and spent by taking a Flaw. 
Talents have a point cost, and Flaws have a negative point costs, 
they give you points back that you can spend on more talents. 
See chapter 4.0 for a list of Talents and Flaws.

## Mixed Ancestry/Species

Most species have a dominant Talent where they have two tiers 
and a regressive Talent where they have a single tier. Some species 
will have genetic Flaws that confer a penalty, but these are balanced 
by having additional Talents. If you want to create mixed heritage 
species, you may mix the Talents and flaws from the two ‘parents’. 
You may have no more tiers in a Talent than either parent possessed, 
you may only choose blood Talents that the parents possessed, and you 
may only take a net of 15 points in Talents in total.

**Example Ancestry, the Brute**

The Brute is a physically powerful alien race. They could be seven foot tall, 
furry and exceptionally angry or human-sized warrior insects. The actual 
physical description is either for the GM to decide or to be agreed between 
player and GM.

Brutes get the two tiers of the Toughness Blood Talent and one tier in Physique. 

Total bonuses are +10 Co, +5 St.

**Human**

Humans receive one tier in Self Awareness, one tier in Toughness and 
one tier in Physique. 

Total bonuses are +5 Co, +5 Em and +5 St.

> **Race Creation Example**
>
> Stephen wants to create a unique race for his character. 
> The concept is that in the years before faster than light 
> travel was discovered, humans first explored space using 
> generation ships. The crews that left Earth knew they would 
> never return, and it was the descendants of those crews that 
> would eventually reach their destinations. This new race is 
> a derivative of humans that were separated for thousands of 
> years within a generation ship that eventually stumbled upon 
> a star system that had been colonized millennia after the 
> generation ship had left earth.
>
> Stephen goes on to flesh out more details of what makes this
> species unique and different to standard humans. He calls the
> species ‘First Wave Humans’ as they consider themselves the
> first wave of human expansion.
>
> This race of spaceship confined humans gains one tier in
> Enhanced Hearing +5 to Perception Skill Tests and +10 to Self Discipline.
