#### Unused AP

Any unused AP left at the end of a combat round and not applied to a wrap 
around action are lost.

> **Example:** A character moves into position behind a door hoping to attack 
> anyone who comes through. They declare 1AP of movement and a 3AP attack 
> held until they can use it. In this round no one comes through the door 
> and the player does not want to remain here so the three AP for the attack 
> are lost.
