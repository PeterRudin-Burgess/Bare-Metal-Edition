#Super Powers

Super powers are bought using a bought of 15 development points. These can only be bought at character creation. 
See below for developing and improving super powers.

##Physical Powers

Physical super powers, such as godlike strength or lightning fast reactions are bought using 1DP per +5 bonus.

Physical powers can include bonuses to a characters stats or specific skills.

##Projected Powers

Projected powers have effects outside of the characters normal physical form. 
These are bought using the magic/spell creation rules. 
One development point is equal to one Mana point for power creation purposes.

Once a power has been defined it does not require mana to be spent to use the power.

##Special Effects

Special effects have no direct impact on the game beyond narrative effects. 
If you buy the power of flight you can decide if you have wings or jet boots or a hovering surfboard. 
In the game fiction using a firey energy blast on someone holding a million dollars may send the cash up in smoke, 
just as your Atlantian water blast could turn the bills into a soggy mash. 
Special effects confer no mechanical advantage without GM consent, 
and even then the GM may confer a balancing disadvantage.

##Improving Powers

When a character gains a level the player can spend DPs on improving powers. 
1DP confers +1 to a physical attribute or skill power or 1Mana to be used to develop projected powers.

Existing phyical powers may be developed and improved and new attributes developed each level at the 1DP/+1 rate.

Existing projected powers can be improved incrementally. 
New projected powers need to be paid for in full in a single level. 
DPs cannot be carried over from multiple levels to buy more expensive powers.
