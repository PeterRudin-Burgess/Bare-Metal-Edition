# Culture

Each character has a culture that reflects the society where they spent 
their early life and formative years. This culture bestows 17 skill ranks 
on the character. These ranks may be recorded directly on to the character 
record.

Many of the cultural skills allow for specializations such as Music. In 
this case the player may either place all the ranks in a single specialism
or spread the ranks over multiple skills. A character with three ranks in 
Performing Arts could take three ranks in Singing or a single rank in each 
of Singing, Dance and Playing the Guitar.

The example cultures are:

## Cosmopolitan
 
Cosmopolitan: Characters from this culture come from worlds and cities 
that see all types of life and influence.

First Aid 	2 ranks	
Scanners 	2 ranks
Science: General 	2 ranks

## Harsh
 
Harsh: Harsh worlds breed tough inhabitants. These are either worlds
with hostile environments or fringe worlds where modern technology is 
often just too expensive.

water or under the oceans.

## Star faring

Star faring: Star farers have no homeworld, they are born and bred on board ships or space stations, and for them, shipboard life is the norm.

Music: Instrument 	1 rank	
First Aid 	2 ranks	
Scanners 	2 ranks	Science: General 	2 ranks

Note, changing Space Pilot, Space Navigation and Scanners for their naval 
equivalent would create a seafaring culture, such as pirates.

## Reaver

Reaver: Reaver culture is based on raiding and piracy. 
This is the most violent of cultures.

hostile to support life, but below the surface, thriving cities spread 
out and grow around the richest resources.

## Provincial

Provincial: Provincial worlds and rural culture is often a simple life. 
The worlds are often young but not as hostile to life as they could be. 
Often the dividing line between a harsh world and a provincial world is 
that provincial worlds produce surpluses that they can export and they 
buy in luxuries they cannot produce themselves.

## Creating Your Own Cultures

Each culture contains 17 ranks of skills from across all the categories. 
Building your own cultures will add a level of detail to your game universe. 
You could have multiple cultures within a single nation where people are 
repressed and have less access to education but the ruling classes value 
sciences and the arts.
