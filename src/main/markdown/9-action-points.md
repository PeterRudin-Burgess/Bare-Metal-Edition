### 9.0 Action Points

Each round *(5 seconds)* a character receives 4 action points *(AP)*. 
Every action a character performs has a cost in action points. 
A character may choose to spend less than the listed number of AP on a task. 
For every AP that is not used a -25 penalty is applied to the skill test. 
At the start of the round the player declares all four action points and 
the order in which they wish them to play out. 

> **Example:** A character is hiding beside an open door. The player declares 
> that they want to use 1AP to move into the open doorway, 2AP to shoot into 
> the room and 1 AP to move to the other side of the doorway back behind cover.

### AP Costs Table

|Action |AP| |Action |AP|
|:---------------|:------:|----|:---------------|:------:|
|Cast Psion/Meditation/Gift|3| |Concentration|2|
|Melee Attack|2-4| |Ranged Attack|2-4|
|Reload Weapon|2| |Perception Test|1|
|Swimming Test|2-4| |Climbing Test|2-4|
|Stand up from seat/kneel/crouch|free| |Stand from prone|1|
|Move more than base|1-4| |Draw weapon|1|
|Change weapons|2| |Mount Animal|2-4|
|First Aid test|4| |Stalk/Hide Test|1|

The costs are a selection of suggested minimum costs. 
To use any skill without penalty 4AP must be spent completing the test. 
Where a range is specified the lower figure is the absolute minimum number 
of AP that may be used. 
Where a single figure is stated these are fixed costs and cannot be avoided.

#### Fast Actions

You may use less than the required number of AP for skill tests. 
For each AP not spent completing the task a -25 penalty is applied to the skill test.

Ranged Attacks are listed as 2AP. 
To complete a ranged attack with no penalty still requires 4AP, 
but the shot may be made in 2AP at -50 penalty. 

A character could fire twice using two 2AP attacks and both would be at -50.

> **Note:** As GM you may allow a Multiple Attack CE skill to reduce the 
> penalty for attacking twice in the same round.

#### Wrap Around Actions

A character may start an action in one combat round and complete it in another. 
For example they could spend 1AP moving into range and then declare a 4AP attack. 
As that requires 5AP the movement would take place at the start of the first 
combat round and the attack would not be resolved until the 1st AP of next round.

#### Unused AP

Any unused AP left at the end of a combat round and not applied to a wrap 
around action are lost.

> **Example:** A character moves into position behind a door hoping to attack 
> anyone who comes through. They declare 1AP of movement and a 3AP attack 
> held until they can use it. In this round no one comes through the door 
> and the player does not want to remain here so the three AP for the attack 
> are lost.
