## 4.0 Talents and Flaws

Talents are split into two types. Blood Talents are used for creating 
species and Personal Talents are special abilities that the character 
may possess. These rules will give just the barest minimum of Blood Talents. 
As new species are introduced, new Blood Talents will be added.

All Talents are described as tiers. For example, the Toughness Talent 
gives +5 Co bonus per tier. A species with two tiers in Toughness will 
game a +10 Co bonus.

All species receive 15 points worth of blood talents and no talent may 
cost more than 15 points for a single tier.

Some Talents may be bought more than once, and every tier bought provides 
additional bonuses. Other talents are all or nothing. Latent Psionic is 
an example of an all or nothing talent. With it, a character may use 
Meditations and Gifts; without it they cannot.

Talents, even blood talents may be used to define a profession or species. 
If a talent is applied twice, such as a psionic species takes a psionic 
profession, the GM may reimburse the character with the DP that had been 
spent twice.

**Flaws**

Flaws are genetic weaknesses. These cost negative points.

### 4.1 Blood Talents

**Enhanced Hearing** -- 5DP/Tier +5/Tier to Perception skill test that 
are dependent on the sense of hearing or where acute hearing is an advantage.

**Insect Eyes** -- 15DP/Tier This is an all or nothing blood talent, 
the species either has insectoid eyes or not so a single tier is all 
that is required. The species receives no penalties to Perception skill 
tests when the threat is to the flank or rear. Only half penalties apply 
when engaged with Invisible foes.

**Latent Psionic** -- 15DP/Tier This talent gives a character the potential 
to unlock their psionic abilities. Without this talent a character may not 
develop their psionic power or learn any meditations. You may only buy this 
talent once.

**Stat Talent** -- 5DP/Tier

* Physique -- +5st Bonus/Tier
* Toughness -- +5Co Bonus/Tier

### 4.2 Blood Flaws

**Weak Constitution** -- -5DP/Tier -5Co/Tier This species is relatively weak 
compared to the norm. Possibly due to coming from a low gravity world where 
they do not need to build up as much muscle mass.

**Sluggishness** -- -5DP/Tier; -5Qu Bonus/Tier
