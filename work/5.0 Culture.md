# 5.0 Culture
Each character has a culture that reflects the society where they spent their early life and formative years. This culture bestows 17 skill ranks on the character. These ranks may be recorded directly on to the character record.
Many of the cultural skills allow for specializations such as Music. In this case the player may either place all the ranks in a single specialism or spread the ranks over multiple skills. A character with three ranks in Performing Arts could take three ranks in Singing or a single rank in each of Singing, Dance and Playing the Guitar.
The example cultures are:

## 5.8 Creating Your Own Cultures

You could have multiple cultures within a single nation where people are repressed and have less access to education but the ruling classes value sciences and the arts.
