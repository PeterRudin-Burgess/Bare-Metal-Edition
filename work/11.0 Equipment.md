#11.0 Equipment Weight
There are only very simple encumbrance guidelines in Navigator RPG (section 17.5). As the GM you should decide what is a suitable amount of gear that a character can carry taking into account the characters description of their species and the characters physical stats. If you feel they are overloaded, tell the player.
An over loaded player should take -10 on all moving maneuver tests. If they take on addition mass each 5kg should cause an additional -5 to maneuver tests.
