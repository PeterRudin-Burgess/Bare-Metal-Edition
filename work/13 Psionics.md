#The Psionic System
The basic psionic system of BME is based on the following principles:

any would-be psionic has to have at least one tier in the Latent Psionic Talent
has developed (or defaults) the Psionic Point Development Skill.
has developed at least the minimum skill-ranks in the Meditation/Gift intended to cast.
The Latent Psionic Talent
The Latent Psionic talent costs 5DP per tier and can only be bought at character creation. Please note some Ancestries, Cultures and/or Archetypes may provide bonus tiers to the talent.

Latent Psionic Tier	PP Dev	Spells
- Tier #0 - None	-	-
- Tier #1 - Initiate	8/8	7/10
- Tier #2 - Student	6/6	5/7
- Tier #3 - Scholar	4/4	3/5
- Tier #4 - Master	3/3	2/4
- Tier #5 - Savant	2/2	1/3
- Tier #6 - Oracle*	1/1	1/1
##Aspects
There are two aspects to psionics. The first is psionic power points. These are bought as a skill. A character with 5 ranks in Psionic Power and a +10 stat bonus would have a total of 35 Psionic Points [PP]. You may not develop the Psionic Power skill unless you have at least one tier in the Latent Psionic talent.

The second element is the actual Mediations or Gifts, called abilities, known and have a base cost in PP and additional options that can scale the effects in different ways. You may not use a Mediation/Gift until you have sufficient ranks in that ability to meet the base cost and you may not put more PP into an ability than you have ranks in that ability.

Every ability is usually developed individually!

**NOTE: A GM may allow multiple spells to be developed at the same time.**

Many effects are dependent on the number of ranks known in the ability.

Durations listed as rounds/rank will last for that many rounds for a single expenditure of PP.

If the duration has a number of rounds and a (C), the duration is the number of rounds or until concentration is broken/stopped, whicher happens first.

Some abilities can be reversed to produce an opposite effect. If this is possible it is listed in the description. The reversed version must be learned independently of the original. You cannot just decide in the moment which version you want.

##Using Abilities
Using psionics is called Projecting. To project an ability the psionic makes a d100 roll adding their Stat Bonus to the Projection Roll (PR). In the case of Mediations this is the sum of Em+In+Pr stat bonuses. For Gifts this is Pr+Re+Sd bonuses.

Most projections require line of sight from Psionic to target. If this is not the case, it will be noted in the description of the ability.

A psionic declares the ability to be projected and the action takes up to 3AP. At the end of the action the PR is made.

**Note: The roll is open ended both up and down.**

If the final result is greater than zero the effect is successfully projected and takes effect.

If the ability can be resisted, and the target is unwilling, they may resist. To resist they make a Resistance Test rolled d100 and adding the sum of two of their stats based on the nature of the Resistance. If their Resistance Test result if greater than the projection roll [PR], they have resisted the effect. If an ability has been resisted it has no effect. Resistance Tests are not compulsory. You do not need to resist an ability that you consent to. If you withdraw consent at any time before the ability is complete, a resistance test is allowed.

This rule exists explicitly to prevent someone being told that the ability is benificial when in reality it is an attempt to control or harm.

##Mediations vs Gifts
Meditations differ from Gifts in a few points.

Gifts:
- are associated with alien species, as such they cannot be taught to other species.
- two members of the same species may combine gifts.

###Species Specific Gifts
Some Gifts may be may be restricted to a specific species. This is left to the GM and is a way of making different species unique. These are not the same as blood talents, as they still require the latent psionic talent and each gift to be developed.

###Combining Gifts
If two psionics of the same species project the same gift, at the same time, they may choose to combine their projecting. In this case, both psionics make a projection roll but the higher or the two total rolls is used for resisting both gifts. Both gifts must be successfuly projected for the combination to take effect. A seperate Resistance Test is required against both of the combined gifts.

##Resolving Psionic Effects
Attacks are resolved by summing: the result of the projection roll, the abilities bonus, minus the defensive bonus of the target and determining the result on the appropriate attack table.

Most other abilities are subject to resistance rolls. The failure level is either used as a modifier for rolls or to establish the magnitude of the effect.

Abilities that emulate the usage of skills are resolved exactly in the same way.

##Psionic Point Recovery
A full complement of Psionic Points [PP] is recovered after a period of rest (as determined by the GM).

The GM may rule on recovery for short periods of rest to recover about one PP per hour per Rank in the Psionic Power Skill.
